Alfresco Content Service will be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. This cluster
needs a at least 32GB memory to split among below pods:

* 2 x repository
* 1 x share
* 1 x search
* 2 x pdfrenderer
* 2 x imagemagick
* 2 libreoffice
* 2 tika
* 2 misc
* 1 x postgresql
* 1 activemq

> Note: this is the default settings but requirements can be lowered by
dropping the `replicaCount` value to 1 for each service.

Default CPU and memory requirements for each pods are set as low as e think is
reasonable. If you need to teak the resource allocation you can use the
`resources.limits.cpu` & `resources.limits.memory` for each component of the
platform. Remember that most of them are running in JAVA VM so you might want
to also raise the JVM memory settings (-Xmx) which is possible using pods'
environment variables.
