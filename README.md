# Alfresco Content Services Deployment

## Contributing guide
Please use [this guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to make a contribution to the project and information to report any issues.

This project contains the code for starting the entire Alfresco Content Services (Enterprise) product with **Docker** or **Kubernetes**.

The **master** branch of this repository will endeavour to support the following deployments:
- [Docker Compose](docs/docker-compose-deployment.md) (latest): For development and trials
- [MiniKube](docs/helm-deployment-minikube.md) (latest): For development and POCs
- [Helm - AWS Cloud with Kubernetes](docs/helm-deployment-aws_cloud.md) (latest): For production or as a basis of production deployments

For the Community edition, go to the [acs-community-deployment](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-community-deployment).
The only differences between these projects are:
* In the Enterprise chart, the images for the transformers are used, instead of the included binaries.
* In the Enterprise chart, a cluster of two `alfresco-content-repository` nodes are started by default.
