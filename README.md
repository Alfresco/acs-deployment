# Alfresco Content Services Deployment

## Contributing guide
Please use [this guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to make a contribution to the project.

This project contains the code for starting the entire Alfresco Content Services (Enterprise) product with **Docker** or **Kubernetes**.

For the Community edition, go to the [acs-community-deployment](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-community-deployment).
The only differences between these projects are:
* In the Enterprise chart, the images for the transformers are used, instead of the included binaries.
* In the Enterprise chart, a cluster of two `alfresco-content-repository` nodes are started by default.

1. Alfresco Repository, with:
