This project contains the code for running Alfresco Content Services (ACS) with
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started) using [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) or on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) using [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh).

User docs available at: [https://alfresco.github.io/acs-deployment/](https://alfresco.github.io/acs-deployment/)

## ⚠️ Important Notice

Charts are currently using `bitnamilegacy` images for PostgreSQL and
Elasticsearch. This is due to upcoming changes to the Bitnami Catalog. See the
[Bitnami announcement](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/83267) for
more details. Work on creating our own charts for these components is tracked in
[OPSEXP-3421](https://hyland.atlassian.net/browse/OPSEXP-3421).

## Important changes for Docker Compose

### Repository content store persistence

We've introduced an anonymous volume for the alfresco service to ensure content
store data remains intact across container restarts. This enhancement improves
the user experience when fine-tuning Compose files and allows for repeated use
of `docker compose up -d` without data loss.

### Compose extends feature

We have started to leverage
[extends](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/extends/)
feature of docker compose to improve maintainability of the compose files we
provide. This means that any compose file in
[docker-compose](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/tree/master/docker-compose)
folder cannot be used anymore as a standalone file but must be invoked within
that folder.

If you want to further customize the compose files, make sure to understand and
use the definitions included in the
[commons](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/tree/master/docker-compose/commons)
folder.

## Release

### Helm charts release

New releases are usually made from the default branch. When a bugfix release is
necessary and master branch already received updates that are meant to be
released at a later time, then the release must be made from a branch which
follows the release branch pattern: `release/v$Major.Minor`.

First ensure that:

* the
  [supported-matrix](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-updatecli/blob/master/deployments/values/supported-matrix.yaml)
  reflects the status of the currently released Alfresco products and update if
  necessary before proceeding.
* the [components charts](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-helm-charts) have
  been released in stable versions (no pre-release version should be present in
  Chart.yaml at the time of tagging).

Start the release by opening a PR against the appropriate branch that will:

* Update the [EOL table](docs/index.md#acs-end-of-lifed-versions) in case a version is deprecated
* In [alfresco-content-services](helm/alfresco-content-services/Chart.yaml) and
  [acs-sso-example](helm/acs-sso-example/Chart.yaml) charts:bump chart version
  to the version you want to release.
* Run `pre-commit run --all-files helm-docs` to update helm docs
* Edit [upgrades docs](docs/helm/upgrades.md) renaming the `To be released`
  section to the current version and create a new `To be released` section for
  the future.
* Run [Bump versions][1] workflow against the same newly created branch, the
  first time with `charts` option. Inspect the changes pushed on the branch,
  revert unwanted changes if necessary - all charts dependencies should not be
  using any `-alpha.` version.
* Run [Bump versions][1] workflow against the same branch with option `values`.
  This will update both docker compose tags and helm charts values.
  Inspect the changes pushed on the branch, looking for any missing update.

Once the PR has been merged, create the release with:

```sh
git tag -s vx.x.x -m vx.x.x
git push origin vx.x.x
gh release create vx.x.x --generate-notes -t vx.x.x -d
```

where `vx.x.x` is the same `alfresco-content-services` Chart version.

Once the workflow triggered by this new tag is successful, review the GitHub release notes, usually
removing dependabot entries and other not-really useful changelog entries.

Publish the release (remove draft status).

Once the tagged workflow is successful, the release process is completed.

### Download trials (compose files)

* Ensure the master branch has the latest versions of the Alfresco components
  set in the [compose files](docker-compose/) (specifically `compose.yaml` and
  `community-compose.yaml).
* Run the [Release Download
  trials](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/actions/workflows/download-trials-release.yml)
  workflow.
* Review the [automatically created
  PR](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/pulls) and merge it to
  `download-trial` branch if everything looks good.
