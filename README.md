## Release

### Helm charts release

New releases are usually made from the default branch. When a bugfix release is
necessary and master branch already received updates that are meant to be
released at a later time, then the release must be made from a branch which
follows the release branch pattern: `release/v$Major.Minor`.

First ensure that:

* the
  [supported-matrix](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-updatecli/blob/master/deployments/values/supported-matrix.yaml)
  reflects the status of the currently released Alfresco products and update if
  necessary before proceeding.
* the [components charts](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-helm-charts) have
  been released in stable versions (no pre-release version should be present in
  Chart.yaml).

Start the release by opening a PR against the appropriate branch that will:

* Update the [EOL table](docs/index.md#acs-end-of-lifed-versions) in case a version is deprecated
* In [alfresco-content-services](helm/alfresco-content-services/Chart.yaml),
  bump chart version to the version you want to release
* Run `pre-commit run --all-files helm-docs` to update helm docs
* Edit [upgrades docs](docs/helm/upgrades.md) renaming the `To be released`
  section to the current version and create a new `To be released` section for
  the future.
* Run [Bump versions][1] workflow against the same newly created branch, the
  first time with `charts` option. Inspect the changes pushed on the branch,
  revert unwanted changes if necessary.
* Run [Bump versions][1] workflow against the same branch with option `values`.
  This will update both docker compose tags and helm charts values.
  Inspect the changes pushed on the branch, looking for any missing update.

Once the PR has been merged, create the release with:

```sh
git tag -s vx.x.x -m vx.x.x
git push origin vx.x.x
gh release create vx.x.x --generate-notes -t vx.x.x -d
```

where `vx.x.x` is the same `alfresco-content-services` Chart version.

Once the workflow triggered by this new tag is successful, review the GitHub release notes, usually
removing dependabot entries and other not-really useful changelog entries.

Publish the release (remove draft status).

Once the tagged workflow is successful, the release process is completed.
