# Alfresco Content Services Helm Deployment with external Hazelcast cluster

- [Alfresco Content Services Helm Deployment with external Hazelcast
  cluster](#alfresco-content-services-helm-deployment-with-external-hazelcast-cluster).
  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  - [Known issues](#known-issues)
  - [Step by step guide](#step-by-step-guide)
  - [Tests](#tests)

## Prerequisites

- Having installed either of:
  - [Rancher for Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/). Includes kubectl and
    Helm, ready to use right after installation.
  - [Docker for Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). Requires separate
    install of kubectl and Helm.

## Known issues

  This feature won't be showing proper server details on Alfresco UI in
  Repository Server Clustering under section Cluster Members. Alfresco
  repository pod will be still present after scaling it down. Pod with new name
  will be added to list but the older will still remain. To verify that the
  solution is working you can check management center or do manual test described
  in [Tests](#tests)

## Step by step guide

1. Deploy alfresco-content-services. See [desktop deployment](../desktop-deployment.md) section. Remember to stick to one
   namespace in next steps.

2. Prepare a valid Hazelcast xml configuration, which also must include
   different cache definitions depending on the ACS version. Please search the
   [Alfresco Products Official Documentation][alfresco-docs-site] for detailled
   description of how to generate it for your version of Alfresco.
   For testing you can use config generated by us on 23.2.0-M1 and skip to 7th
   step.
    - Example file:
      [caches.properties](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-community-repo/blob/master/repository/src/main/resources/alfresco/caches.properties)

3. Replace the `<cluster-name>` within the `alfresco-hazelcast-config.xml`file
   with a secure value that is hard to guess. For all intents and purposes this
   field  should be treated as a password, as if matching it allows
   client-server / member-member connection.

4. Add appropriate configuration for kubernetes autodiscovery feature and [rest
   api
   groups](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.3/maintain-cluster/rest-api#using-rest-endpoint-groups)
   depending on your choice.

    ```xml
    <network>
        <join>
            <kubernetes enabled="true">
                <service-name>hazelcast</service-name>
            </kubernetes>
        </join>
        <rest-api enabled="true">
            <endpoint-group name="DATA" enabled="true"/>
        </rest-api>
    </network>
    <jet enabled="true">
    </jet>
    ```

5. Optionally change the values for management center. Either enter the internal
   network address of your k8s or delete the whole section.

    ```xml
    <management-center data-access-enabled="true">
        <trusted-interfaces>
            <interface>10.42.0.*</interface>
        </trusted-interfaces>
    </management-center>
    ```

6. Now preparation of the xml configuration is finished. Next step is to create
   configmap manifest. Add below section to newly created file:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: manual-hazelcast-configuration
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: hazelcast
    data:
      hazelcast.xml: |
    ```

    Now copy generated xml configuration into manifest file. (Remember to
    correctly indent copied text)

7. Deploy created [manifest](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/blob/master/docs/helm/examples/external-hazelcast_files/configmap-hazelcast.yaml)

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap-hazelcast.yaml
    ```

8. Deploy hazelcast with [values](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/blob/master/docs/helm/examples/external-hazelcast_files/hazelcast.yaml)
   presented below

    ```yaml
    hazelcast:
      javaOpts: -Dhazelcast.config=/data/hazelcast/hazelcast.xml
      existingConfigMap: manual-hazelcast-configuration
    mancenter:
      enabled: true
        yaml:
          hazelcast-client:
            cluster-name: test
    ```

    ```bash
    helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
    helm repo update
    helm install hazelcast hazelcast/hazelcast -f hazelcast.yaml
    ```

9. Now change the config of alfresco-repository by adding another [values
   file](https://github.com/Alfresco/acs-deployment/blob/master/docs/helm/examples/external-hazelcast_files/acs-hazelcast.yaml). In below file specify
   properties that will make repository use external hazelcast cluster deployed
   in previous step. Remember to accordingly change the values if needed.

    ```yaml
    alfresco-repository:
      replicaCount: 3
      config:
        repository:
          additionalGlobalProperties:
            alfresco.hazelcast.embedded: false
            alfresco.hazelcast.client.address: hazelcast:5701
            alfresco.cluster.name: test
    ```

    ```bash
    helm upgrade acs helm/alfresco-content-services \
    --values local-dev_values.yaml \
    --atomic \
    --timeout 10m0s \
    --values acs-hazelcast.yaml
    ```

## Tests

1. Make sure that you have installed fresh environment. Do not login into
   Alfresco UI yet.

2. Get into a shell of container created by previous commands.

    ```bash
    kubectl run -i --tty --rm --image ubuntu test-shell -- /bin/bash
    ```

3. Execute curl command against all hazelcast nodes.

    ```bash
    curl http://hazelcast-0.hazelcast.default.svc.cluster.local:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/cache.usernameToTicketIdCache/admin -o -
    ```

    ```bash
    curl http://hazelcast-1.hazelcast.default.svc.cluster.local:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/cache.usernameToTicketIdCache/admin -o -
    ```

    ```bash
    curl http://hazelcast-2.hazelcast.default.svc.cluster.local:5701/hazelcast/rest/maps/cache.usernameToTicketIdCache/admin -o -
    ```

    You should get empty response.

4. Login into Alfresco UI on
   `http://localhost/alfresco/s/enterprise/admin/admin-clustering` and after
   that repeat commands from previous step. You should see response from all
   nodes similar to this:

    ```bash
    ????????admin????(92023d8ea10294a2e32b238963e67d8013342e30
    ```
