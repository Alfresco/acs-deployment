# Security

This pages focuses on providing information on making a secure ACS installation via Helm Charts.

## Secrets inside values

When using Helm charts to deploy applications, it is necessary to include
sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, in the chart's values
file. This is because the values file is used to generate the chart's
configuration templates, which are then used to deploy the application.

While it may be tempting to include the secrets directly in the values file,
this is not considered a secure practice and should be done only for test environments.

For production deployments there are a few possibilities that we provide here
just for reference:

* [helm-secrets](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets)
* [Mozilla SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops)
* [Sealed secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)

In the ACS helm charts you will find the possibility to provide such secrets in
an alternative way. Instead of providing clear-text values, it's possibile to
provide them by referencing multiple Kubernetes secrets, setting the
appropriate `existingSecretName` values available in the different charts.
Those Kubernetes Secrets needs to be created before attempting the helm install.

As example, you can provide the `repository.adminPassword` value as secret by creating:

```sh
kubectl -n your-namespace create secret generic "repo-secret" \
    --from-literal=REPO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=209c6174da490caeb422f3fa5a7ae634
```

And by setting `existingSecretName` to `repo-secret` instead of `repository.adminPassword`.

Reference the autogenerated README.md in each chart to understand which are the
secrets that can be provided alternatively using existing Kubernetes Secrets.
