# Security

This pages focuses on providing information on making a secure ACS installation
via Helm Charts.

## Secrets inside values

When using Helm charts to deploy applications, it is necessary to include
sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, in the chart's values
file. This is because the values file is used to generate the chart's
configuration templates, which are then used to deploy the application.

While it may be tempting to include the secrets directly in the values file,
this is not considered a secure practice and should only be done for test
environments.

For production deployments, there are different solutions that can work for
every Helm chart. Most of them permit encrypting secrets values and decrypting
them on-the-fly only when they are needed. Some of the most commonly used
solutions are:

* [helm-secrets](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets)
* [Mozilla SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops)
* [Sealed secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)

Reference the autogenerated README.md in each chart to understand which secrets
can be provided using existing Kubernetes Secrets:
